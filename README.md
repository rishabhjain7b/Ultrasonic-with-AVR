# Ultrasonic-with-AVR

I was unable to interface Ultrasonic sensor with AVR microcontroller earlier.
Its so easy to interface it with Arduino and Raspberry Pi but doing the same using only Embedded C was a bit tricky.

This code uses a LCD interfaced with AVR microcontroller in 4-bit mode.
Also it shows how to simply interface Ultrasonic sensor with your AVR microcontroller.

Star if you liked it or if it helped you.
Thank You.
